As a start it may be worth touching on the musical genre of [Plunderphonics]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plunderphonics ), ~

As video handling on the internet started to become slightly viable and video editing software got good and avalible enough for formerly professional software to start being used unprofessionally. ~ 

![~]()

I would say for the most part that they started to die out along with the MLG parodies, but an area did survive was YTPMV. Perhaps it was the higher bar of entry that nessescitated some level of competency and therefore quality that ensure its survival.

The skill aspect is commonly where I personally tend to gravitate towards. I like 'No BGM' a.k.a. no background music instances, where the creator does not have the backing track masking imperfections or missing elements, everything has to have been recreated, and functionally accurate.

the sample focused musical cover aspect of the comunity in some parts evolved into the 'Mashup' genre, the YTP lineage is aparent in the editing of how mashups are presented visually~

In the winter of ~ the now defunct electronics company 'hhgregg' released a fairly standard advert for the festive season, complete with a carol which's lyrics have been replaced with a list of things you can buy.

In the following summer of ~ that was actually a repurposing of their previous Christmas ~. The furthest point away from Christmas in a year is uncommonly acknowledged but does exist in the Southern Hemisphere as an ernist winter festivity, it is unclear which direction 'hhgregg' was aiming but the contextual obtuseness did seem to capture peoples attention.

The already musical nature of it meant that 'hhgregg' commercial ~ a mashup/remix of "Doin' it Right" by Daft Punk and featuring ~ called 'doin' by HydroDalek was uploaded to YouTube 2015 March 27th. ~.

~. The genre ~

This would later get expanded upon in 'redoin' by JerryTerry, uploaded 2017 August 10th. Here we have a ground up rebuild of the concept~ as well as the addition of many split second appearances of Joey from 'Friends'. ~

~. In the added graphics; the pegging of the price being moved 2 digits to the left without condradicing they are saying, a ~ for $2.99 is neither subtle nor lampshaded, it stands as a pedantic interpretation of what is said, in some sense this alone is the bloodstained lifeforce of a chiptune nerd's teenage punk mood. ~

I have found that it is never exactly clear why these got the traction that ~ but their relitive quality and novelty doesn't seem to have hurt. ~

These are far from the be all and end all of the culture, but they feel almost architypal. With the company going under and the accociation with the new context the mascot 'HH' ~ used as a character by the likes of SiIvagunner and their cohorts, where they are equal parts creative catalyst and subject of humour.

~

And to the person I know for whom 'HH' gets their motor running; shine on you crazy diamond.
