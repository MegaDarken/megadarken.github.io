> "TAKE THE UNIVERSE AND GRIND IT DOWN TO THE FINEST POWDER AND SIEVE IT THROUGH THE FINEST SIEVE AND THEN SHOW ME ONE ATOM OF JUSTICE, ONE MOLECULE OF MERCY. AND YET—Death waved a hand. AND YET YOU ACT AS IF THERE IS SOME IDEAL ORDER IN THE WORLD, AS IF THERE IS SOME...SOME RIGHTNESS IN THE UNIVERSE BY WHICH IT MAY BE JUDGED."  
- Death in **Hogfather** (1996) by Terry Pratchett

It is not lost on me that the manifestation of death is the one to say this. Life and death are difficult to define in the easiest and most contrived of circumstances, it continues to be elusive in both phylosophy and information theory. In the real world with real complexity a complete definition may actually be impossible.

Within René Descartes's 'Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One's Reason and of Seeking Truth in the Sciences' (1637) skepticim is taken to the ultimate end that the only thing you can be certain of is your own consciousness' existance, and that's only existance of it, nothing about its nature can be confirmed. That is the kind of extreme you can go to if you are willing to.

As an aside; if your mind is the only certain truth, how does mind altering substances relate to that? Do the effects and impact on the mind exist in some capacity, even if you are being decived in all other ways, or is such a direct impact on the capabilites of the only ground truth also an illusion? If the impact itself, and not just the cause, is an illusion is the implecation that the mind has the capability to operate in such a way so as to manipulate or deceive itself but for some reason does not under normal circumstances? Perhaps this is the case, we can't rule out almost anything and the plasibo effect is a powerful thing.

As of writing this the main thing people go to for the definition of life would be the biological description, that being something along the lines of having the capacity to regulate, sustain itself, and reproduce. The definition is a solid one in isolation.

However; the line, and the specifics of that description, are frequently debated, and will be for a long time, as it should be. The current description is not terrible, but within it there is still minutia. Viruses modify other organisms to produce more of themselves rather than preforming any traditional form of reproduction, but many consider them to still be alive. Many crystaline structures expand and produce more of itself when materials are avalible despite it being generally inert matter. If an automated assembly line for automated assembly lines makes an automated assembly line for automated assembly lines, did it reproduce?

I am not convinced that there even is a true line, I think it is a fuzzy range of aliveness being proportional to complexity. However, in a zeitgeist hostile to nuance many will take such as answer to not be an answer, or consider it to not count.

In the same vein, focus and achknowledgement of nuance at all can be met with derision, as it seen as the evasion of a charlatain. Confident promises, no matter how groundless, are what people flock around.

It seems the only place I can have solice in certainty is Mathematics. Mathematics exists as if it is outside of our reality, it can feel like an astraction of meatspace but it has a more stable ground truth than anything we have been able physically observe. The are such thourgh proofs for even the most fundimental ~

Is it ironic that most of those who would oppose the idea that such comfort could be found in Mathematics appear to be the same people as those so hostile against ambiguity. I don't think it is a coinsidence, I think it is a fundimental problem with mindset, perhaps with how things are categorised in there.

However do not mistake my love of such certainties as a desire to in some way manufacture certainty from obseration, like so many seem to. I would rather not know and admit that than be inaccurate. And there will be many contexts in which going on the aggressive defence is the expected responce to even the implecation of uncertainty, or even just that someone else could be right. It is possible for both you and the person you are arguing to both be right, light is both a wave and particle, the blury distant smudges are both distant collections of stars and near clouds of gas.

I am certain of almost nothing but at least I do not delude myself with ego soothing fictions.

Thankfully I do still come across people who seem to lack this sort of stubornness and seem to have done quite well because of that, I hear anedotally that John Carmack is very quick to admit when he is wrong about something and  ~
