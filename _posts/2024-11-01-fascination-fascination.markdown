I have long delighted in other people's happiness, but, like with many other aspects of my life, a major draw of my focus is the interesting uniqueness of someone's source of happyness.

In some contexts and circles this might be refered to as a 'special interest', ~

A notable known example ~

A personal example that sticks in my mind would be when I noticed how lopsided the Heathcliff wiki is. We see, despite Heathcliff estensibly being a newspaper comic strip first and foremost, little of that is documented. The vast majority of that wiki is actually focused on the animated show 'Heathcliff and the Cadillac Cats' with much of these contrabutions being the work of a single person. Tens of thousands of edits over the course of only a few years, a drop in the bucket for some but that's the sort of passion fueled by pure admiration that I respect. ~

As an aside; people seem to intuitively think of Heathcliff as a bootleg Garfield despite it coming first, ~. In spite of his threats and the ambiguous fate of Lyman the Garfield murder arc remains headcanon, while Heathcliff's rampage and criminal empire hard to keep track of. While not quite on the same level, I would say that Heathcliff is closer to something like Gary Larson's **Farside** than **Garfield**, at least in its aim, with its focus on snapshots abserdist scenarios rather than setup and responce jokes.

~ in my mind perhaps I am in some way vicariously viewing the subject through them, am I attempting emulate their own joy, would this be in lue of mine? That being said; I don't know whether I envy them, but I certainly find joy in their existance. I do sometimes wonder if there something lurid about my passive observation, would engaging with them be worse, it is certainly some form of interferance wildlife documentaries would frown upon,  ~.
