Kenku are a crow-like humanoid from the Dungeons and Dragons tabletop roleplaying game, they are essentially able mimic sounds and writing flawlessly but are divinely cursed to be incapable of creativity or originality, with anything they attempt being doomed to be derivitive.

I find the implication of this curse's existance worth examining. Many can and have argued that true originally is an illusion and that anything creative can trace its roots to previous stories or nature. While people can conceptually acknowledge something like a new color, is it possible to visualise a color or other sense that you have not experienced before?

If you run with this idea, and view the curse in the context of the writers as a manifestation of how creativity can seem to work; it is simultaniously possible to view the Kenku's curse as being effectively real and as a commentary on creativity that makes it in effect ineffectual but treated as real regardless. This dicotomy is one that I would like to see explored further, as I feel there is a lot you can do with this.

If instead the curse is acting further upon the Kenku then to what degree are they limited? Would combining the elements and story points of many other stories allowed or is the recombination of stories a or creativity? Does the field of engineering and invention find itself included in this? Would the application of simple machines and the analysis of material parameters be permited in building a functional mechanism, or is there the naive implication that functionality is mutually exclusive with creativity.

It is possible that the broad vague definition is purposefully there, allowing for flexibility in the roleplaying. At the same time, that could be fairly generous, it could just be a lucky bonus of an interesting flaw.
