While the creation of this site is the beginning of my work being documented, I have been working on various projects in various forms for a long time. It has also been a while that I have considered making some of my work, or at least some details about it, publicly available. I think what is driving this is related to my admiration of preservation, and the boon that such preserved articles can provide. If anything proves useful to you then I think this will have been worth it.

The order, frequency and subject matter of posts should be considered arbitrary.
