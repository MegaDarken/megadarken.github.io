When rendering with any consideration for the directions surfaces are facing, such as almost any time that lighting is involved, having or calculating a polygon's normal vector becomes effectively nessercery.

For a quick overview; a surface normal is effectively a vector that points directly out of the surface, you could think about it in term of the direction that part of the face is flatly towards. ~
