> "TAKE THE UNIVERSE AND GRIND IT DOWN TO THE FINEST POWDER AND SIEVE IT THROUGH THE FINEST SIEVE AND THEN SHOW ME ONE ATOM OF JUSTICE, ONE MOLECULE OF MERCY. AND YETâ€”Death waved a hand. AND YET YOU ACT AS IF THERE IS SOME IDEAL ORDER IN THE WORLD, AS IF THERE IS SOME...SOME RIGHTNESS IN THE UNIVERSE BY WHICH IT MAY BE JUDGED."  
- Death in **Hogfather** (1996) by Terry Pratchett

It is not lost on me that the manifestation of death is the one to say this. Life and death are difficult to define in the easiest and most contrived of circumstances, in the real world with real complexity a complete definition may actually be impossible. As of writing this a technical definition appears to be ~ The line is frequently debated, ~ I am not convinced that there even is a true line, I think it is a fuzzy range of aliveness being proportional to complexity, in a zeitgeist hostile to nuance.

In the same vein, focus and achknowledgement of nuance can be met with derision, as it seen as the evasion of a charlatain. ~

It seems the only place I can have solice in certainty is Mathematics. Mathematics exists as if it is outside of our reality, it can feel like an astraction of meatspace but it has a more stable ground truth than anything we have been able physically observe. ~

Is it ironic that most of those who would oppose the idea that such comfort could be found in Mathematics appear to be the same people as those so hostile against ambiguity. ~

However do not mistake my love of such certainties as a desire to in some way manufacture certainty from obseration, like so many seem to. I would rather not know and admit that than be inaccurate. And there will be many contexts in which ~. It is possible for both you and the person you are arguing to both be right, light is both a wave and particle. ~

I am certain of almost nothing but at least I do not delude myself with ego soothing fictions.
