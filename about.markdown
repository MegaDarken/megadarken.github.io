About me, I have worked with a fair variety of fields but currently as I write this I am mainly focused on writing software, but I have enjoyed doing Art and Photography in the past. Being a generalist like this is rarely advised but I have found some happyness in it, being able to focus on something very different but still productive I have found has helped mitigate burnout. You can find my code on [my Github](https://github.com/megadarken).

About the site, you can view is as my portfolio, but I expect that it will in some aspects also function as a blog about the work in that portfolio.
